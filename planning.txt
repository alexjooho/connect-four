Before looking at our code, take a few minutes to think about how you would build a game like this using HTML/JS/CSS:

1. what HTML would be useful for the game board itself?
    h1 initial heading with the name connect four centered
    making sqare boxes (each could be a divs) of the 7x 6 grid
    making 1 row of transparent boxes on the top row
    

2. how could you represent a played-piece in the HTML board?
    makes the div turn either red or white - once the box is clicked, you cannot click it again. look at flip card code to block

3. in the JavaScript, what would be a good structure for the in-memory game board?
    [array of values] if an array has 4 Blue or Red values horizontal/vertical alert winner (prev problem set on the grid)
4. what might the flow of the game be?
    start a new game. either refresh the browser or create a button
    initial click is blue followed by red until someone wins or all the boxes/arrays are full

5. Then, write down some functions names/descriptions that would be useful for this game.
    function resetGame will reload the html and make all of the boxes clickable
    function selectEmptySquare click event that will select an empty box and turn it red or blue
    function changePlayers will alternate between red or blue colors
    function trackMoves can track the moves of each player
    function alertWinner when either blue  or red wins. sends a notification
    function alertGameover when all the boxes are full and neither player has 4 in a row.
